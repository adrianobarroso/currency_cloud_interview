# Currency Cloud ruby app for technical evaluation

On `/lib` you will find the core of the app.

To run the app you must clone it on you machine and run the script app.rb.

```
ruby app.rb
```

Also the unit tests and some integration test are on `/spec` folder.

To run them you need to just run the command:

```
rake
```

I used *rbenv* to facilitate ruby version.

If you have any question just create an issue or tag me on any code line.

Thank you.
